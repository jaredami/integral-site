          Yellow is the first system to become highly sensitive to the
          differences and uniqueness of people at all of the various levels. It
          is able to accumulate a great deal of knowledge and information about
          the origins, characteristic, and contours of each system along the
          Spiral, and even begins to search for ways to integrate them with one
          another. But, those who have reached Yellow rely heavily on the self,
          and are virtually alone in this pursuit to create harmony throughout
          the Spiral. As it turns out, the questions posed by Yellow cannot be
          adequately addressed by lone human beings. The problems that Yellow
          identifies are simply too complex and expansive for any individual to
          solve. The next stage of human development will require a return to a
          community-driven, ‘we’-focused mentality in order to build on the
          insight of Yellow and apply it on massive scales.
        </p>
        <p>
          The new stage of human development that will be required to solve
          these integrative problems has been labeled as ‘Turquoise’ within
          Spiral Dynamics. This is the newest system which has appeared within
          humanity, and is inevitably the least well-understood of any of the
          value systems. Some researchers estimate that it accounts for less
          than 0.1% of the population.
        </p>

          Turquoise sees the world in holistic terms, viewing everything as
          profoundly interconnected. Whereas Green’s circle of empathy extended
          only to those who share the same values, the holistic nature of
          healthy Turquoise defines a world community more broadly: Every
          person, every species, and every expression of life belongs as a part
          of single planetary ecosystem. All of Earth’s inhabitants are
          interconnected and interdependent.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          This system integrates feeling and knowing by reactivating a trust in
          intuition and instinct, but at a new level which allows for the joint
          participation of both conscious and subconscious mental processes.
          Turquoise learns not only from observation and participation, but
          through the experience of simply being. Life experiences have shown
          that one can never know or understand all things, and an acceptance of
          this fact leads to awe, wonder, reverence, humility, unity, and a
          refreshed value for simplicity. For Turquoise, reality can be
          experienced, but never fully known.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          There can be a resurgence of a form of spirituality at this level, but
          often not in terms of an identifiable someone in active, deliberate
          control. Instead, a unifying force and set of guiding principles sets
          the course for the universe and provides the ground of being itself.
          Some choose an anthropomorphic view of this force, and others do not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turquoise is able to reconnect with certain Tier One aspects which may
          have been stifled during the developmental journey, while also
          activating untapped capacities within the mind and brain. With these
          deeper mental and spiritual abilities awakened, a much wider range of
          new possibilities emerges.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, we must remember that this new system is not better,
          nicer, or more intelligent than any others. This increase in
          conceptual complexity will entail more expansive thinking and a
          broader range of behavioral options, but that does not guarantee that
          people at this stage will be happy or virtuous. They are in many ways
          looking through a lens which is more powerful, but whether this
          perspective will prove to be beneficial or destructive is an open
          question.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          And of course, as with every previous level, there is the potential
          for both healthy and unhealthy expressions of this value system.
          Again, just because a system includes more of the Spiral, that does
          not preclude destructive ideas and attachments. If Turquoise is indeed
          a revisiting of Purple at an ‘octave up’, one unsettling possibility
          is that the strong ‘in-group versus out-group’ mentality of Purple
          will resurface with Turquoise in the form of Global Tribalism. A world
          in which Turquoise based communities become dominant may be a world in
          which we see community division on a grand scale. These partitions
          could be drawn along racial, geographic, ideological, or some other
          form of globe-spanning boundaries. One can only hope that compassion,
          altruism, and cooperation will prevail as this new system begins to
          permeate.
