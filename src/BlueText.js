        <h2>The Absolute Order</h2>
        <p>
          Blue arose out of a need to create order and stability out of the
          chaos and turmoil of Red. This sense of order could not be achieved
          within Red’s every-man-for-himself way of thinking. A return to
          community was needed, but on a much grander scale. In the last
          sacrifice-self system (Purple), the in-group was limited to members of
          The Tribe. That is, one’s ‘circle of empathy’ extended only within the
          boundaries of kinship and shared proximity. The arrival of Blue
          represented a tremendous leap forward in man’s ability to unite and
          cooperate, and one which is seen nowhere in the animal kingdom. For
          the first time, we gained the ability to join together, not just on
          the basis of heredity, but on the basis of shared belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blue entails sacrificing one’s own desires for the good of the group,
          and encourages the delay of gratification for the promise of future
          reward. Blue introduced meaning, purpose, and objective morality into
          the human drama, as Blue societies and communities unite on the basis
          on shared belief and devotion to a transcendent purpose or cause.
          Within Blue, life has a definitive meaning and purpose, with
          predetermined outcomes. Often, a central text serves as an
          authoritative manual or guidebook for good living. Social systems
          emphasize respect for authority. Traditions, institutions, and rigid
          social hierarchies create structure and stability. Everything has its
          proper place and a reason behind it in Blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moral standards and ethical obligations that Blue introduced laid
          the foundation for the Rule of Law within society. Whereas in Red the
          strongest rise to the top, within Blue it no longer matters how strong
          you are since the rules apply to everyone, regardless of individual
          strength or ability. Criminals could now expect punishment for their
          wrongdoings, and those who followed the rules were rewarded with some
          degree of justice and security. Social systems within Blue tend to be
          hierarchical, putting everyone in right-and-proper roles. Castes,
          grades, races, classes, seniority levels, and military ranks all
          emerge out of the inherent structure of life. Everyone is expected to
          know their place and keep to it.
        </p>
        <h2>Blue in Individual Development</h2>
        <p>
          In terms of our individual development, many enter Blue after a period
          of rebelliousness and self-assertion. A child tentatively begins to
          experiment with the notions of right and wrong, fair and unfair,
          sharing with others, and resolving problems with the aid of authority
          (“ask the teacher”). Blue solidifies with the emotional embrace of a
          moral cause, such as the pre-teen who becomes infatuated with
          recycling. One begins to grapple with existential questions, asking
          “Why am I here?”, “What’s this all about?” One must search for a
          foundation upon which to anchor the meaning and purpose of their
          lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its healthiest expression, individuals with strong Blue are some of
          the most comfortable, self-assured, and tranquil humans on the planet.
          Those with a healthy and strong Blue expression know why they are here
          and what is to come, filling their lives with tremendous assurance and
          purpose. Indeed, many people need a Blue rock upon which to tie their
          lives and to anchor morality, ethics, and civility. Many of today’s
          youth have not discovered a self-sacrificing moral compass, and thus
          are left to rely on self-interest and the pursuit of their own
          desires. The Blue system also produces some of the most hardworking
          and charitable members of society, as their deep sense of moral
          obligation motivates them towards extreme diligence and generosity.
        </p>
        <h2>The Immortal Man in Blue and its Shadow Side</h2>
        <p>
          As the immortal man transitions from Red to Blue, he begins to search
          for a sense of meaning and direction, as well as salvation from his
          egocentric tendencies. His quest leads him into the welcoming embrace
          of “The Order”- a fictional religious cult which promises to provide
          the immortal man with all of the enticing elements of Blue: a reason
          to live and die, a code of conduct based on absolute principles,
          eternal salvation, and a community united under a shared devotion to a
          transcendent cause.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          But, one of the key ideas within Spiral Dynamics is that there are
          healthy and unhealthy expressions of every color. Within The Order,
          the immortal man becomes the victim of one of the most pernicious
          expressions of unhealthy Blue: one in which those in authority abuse
          unquestioning devotion and guilt as a means of control and
          manipulation. The immortal man pledges unflinching loyalty and
          obedience to his newfound haven, and The Order takes full advantage of
          his compliance, controlling him like a puppet for its own selfish
          purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reality of this sort of manipulative manifestation of Blue is
          strikingly portrayed in the 2015 documentary “Going Clear: Scientology
          and the Prison of Belief.” The film depicts how Scientology founder L.
          Ron Hubbard has exploited thousands of decent and intelligent people
          out of their time, effort, and money by convincing them to devote
          themselves to an entirely fabricated system of beliefs, the most
          bizarre elements of which are kept hidden from the vast majority of
          adherents. On the surface, Scientology promises to provide all of the
          same essential elements of Blue that the immortal man discovers within
          The Order. But, behind the scenes, both Hubbard and his eventual
          successor David Miscavige have used the devotion of their congregation
          for personal gain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There have and continue to be many other examples of unhealthy Blue
          expressions. Some of the most troubling manifestations of unhealthy
          Blue arise within the transitional zone between Red and Blue, where
          Red’s desire for action combined with Blue’s need for purpose becomes
          a recipe for ideologically motivated aggression and violence.
          Terrorist groups such as ISIS excel at exploiting the devotion and
          zeal of extreme Red/Blue as motivation for committing appalling acts
          of violence such as suicide bombings and mass shootings.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The history of the Christian Church has been plagued with its fair
          share of destructive Red/Blue as well, as seen in the Inquisition and
          The Crusades. We still see examples of this vehement value system at
          work in groups like the Westboro Baptist Church, who trade the love
          and acceptance of Jesus for hatred and judgment. Their actions seem to
          contradict the central message of the one they claim to follow.
        </p>
        <p>

            “If the preaching of our ministers and the practice of our
            parishioners do not have the same effect on people that Jesus had,
            then we must not be declaring the same message that Jesus did.” -Tim
            Keller
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its potential for negative expressions, it is important to
          remember one of the central messages of Spiral Dynamics - that all of
          the colors provide crucial and valuable aspects of the Spiral. Healthy
          Blue empowers us to unite under a transcendent purpose or goal, commit
          to the pursuit of truth and goodness, and create the structure and
          stability needed within society. We invite everyone to consider how we
          can integrate the best aspects of Blue into our lives, while joining
          together to overcome its most malignant manifestations.
