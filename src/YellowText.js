        <h2>The Integrated Self</h2>
        <p>
          Yellow is the first value system on the Second Tier, and represents
          what Dr. Graves called “a momentous leap” in human consciousness.
          Throughout all six colors of the First Tier, each stage is oblivious
          to the continuous nature of human development, and tends to think of
          itself as the endpoint – the culmination of human values. For the
          first time, Yellow becomes aware of the entire Spiral (either
          explicitly or intuitively), and sees that each stage is a legitimate
          and crucial facet of the Spiral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers estimate that only about 1% of the global population has
          reached this stage. This new mode of thinking recognizes that change
          is inevitable, and that new stages will continue to arise as life
          conditions evolve. Yellow understands and honors the uniqueness of
          each First Tier color and the differences between them. Each value
          system is appropriate and needs to be strong for the human journey to
          continue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some have noted that the Second Tier seems to, in a sense, be a
          repetition of the First Tier, but at a frequency that is “an octave
          up” from its First Tier counterparts. Thus, Yellow represents a return
          the survivalist mentality of the very first value system (Beige),
          except that now, rather than being merely concerned with individual
          survival, it is primarily focused with the survival of the whole
          planet. It strives to take the lessons learned from each of the
          previous stages and apply them to the continued survival and
          flourishing of life itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas each stage of the First Tier is fairly static and hesitant to
          change, Yellow thinking is much more flowing and integrative. Yellow
          sees many plausible approaches and, like a chameleon, can disguise
          itself to adopt the thinking style required by each particular
          situation. For Yellow, each First Tier color represents a noble and
          valid pursuit: Green’s desire to be free of greed and dogma, Blue’s
          search for meaning and purpose, Orange’s drive to excel and achieve,
          Red’s need for power and conquest, and Purple’s urge to draw people
          together into a protective circle. All of the colors, when healthy,
          contribute to the integrity of the Spiral.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yellow represents a more complex system than we’ve ever encountered,
          because it must deal with all previous six systems simultaneously.
          Yellow thinking is systemic, and is able to identify and diagnose the
          complex interactions between the various colors. This increase in
          conceptual complexity results in an unprecedented expansion in
          behavioral freedom. Beck and Cowan reported that people operating from
          Yellow generally tend to get better results with less time and effort,
          as they are able to approach problems in surprising new ways that no
          one else has considered. Few ideas are scared for Yellow, and all are
          subject to review and upgrade to better functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the issues which arise at this integrative level are also
          much more complex and dangerous, and the decisions that must be made
          from a Yellow vantage point often have profound and far-reaching
          consequences. For Yellow, the goal is not to destroy the previous
          systems, but to legitimize and empower them. It’s not about throwing
          out existing institutions, systems, theories of leadership, etc., but
          rather systematically aligning them with their color. This is a
          massively complex task in which there are no simple solutions or easy
          answers. It is common for First Tier colors to shy away from this
          level of complexity and nuance, preferring to paint pictures in black
          and white and with broad brushes. The Second Tier perspective is
          necessary to understand the complex interactions between value
          systems, and it is for this reason that those in leadership positions
          would most benefit from integrating a bit of Yellow thinking into
          their decision making process.

        <h2>The Immortal Man in Yellow</h2>
        <p>
          The ninth track on the record, Prism, follows the immortal man as he
          crosses into Second Tier thinking. For the first time, he is able to
          look back at his life and recognize the various stages he has gone
          through. This new perspective enables him to “see the world in every
          shade”, or to inhabit the mindset of each of the colors. This ability
          enables him to disguise himself to match the colors being expressed by
          others. He understands what stage they are at, and interacts with them
          accordingly. He begins to appreciate his shortsightedness throughout
          his journey up until now. At every stage, he looked back on his old
          ways disdainfully, and was fearful of the next step. He pleads with
          those still fully entrenched in the First Tier to recognize that they
          are not the only bearers of truth. He sees a world of people who
          reject all of the other stages of the Spiral. Ultimately, he feels
          that his attempts are futile. He cannot convince the world to see
          things the way he does. He must embrace the reality of his solitary
          state.
        </p>
        <h2>Yellow in Individual Development</h2>
        <p>
          Most of us have probably not reached immersed ourselves into the
          Yellow system, which is totally fine. The wisdom of Yellow is that in
          order for the entire Spiral to be healthy, each person must be allowed
          to inhabit the color which is most congruent with their current life
          conditions. The problems we each face may require us to operate from
          previous levels at different times, and we will only move up the
          Spiral when our circumstances require it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And yet, there are lessons from the Yellow value system that we can
          all utilize and integrate into our thinking. For example, there is a
          tendency for most of us to completely discard everything about the
          systems we have moved beyond. We tend to throw the baby out with the
          proverbial bathwater, failing to recognize that there are important
          truths and insights to be gleaned from every level. As one moves to
          Red, gaining independence and empowerment, it is essential not to lose
          the sense of belonging and unconditional love discovered in Purple. As
          Blue arrives, we must retain the ability to stand up for one’s self
          learned from Red. The awaking of Orange should not cause us to abandon
          the Blue ability to unite under a transcendent purpose or cause. Green
          must retain the Orange appreciation for change, and the ability of the
          individual to influence change for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are just a few of the important elements of each value system.
          It is up to every one of us to decide which aspects of our former
          selves we want to retain or discard. But, the power of Spiral Dynamics
          lies in its ability to provide a broader and clearer perspective on
          this process. It enables us to approach our individual journey in a
          more conscious and deliberate way, as well as to understand that not
          everyone is at the same point in their development. Through this model
          we learn that it is not always necessary or even possible to change
          someone. You cannot lead someone where they are unable to go. Instead,
          we must respect each other’s journey and recognize that we are all
          just doing our best to cope with the life conditions that we are
          presented with.
        </p>
        <h2>Second Tier Thinking in the Real World</h2>
        <p>
          Just to provide a small taste of what an integrative perspective might
          look like, let us consider our current political climate. Please bear
          in mind that we do not claim to have considerable knowledge or insight
          regarding politics or the complex social and economic issues it
          entails. Surely the analysis which follows is highly debatable in
          terms of the details, but we thought it would be beneficial to provide
          an example of the sort of ways that Spiral Dynamics can potentially be
          used as a tool for understanding and overcoming strong ideological
          differences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The divided between Liberals and Conservatives is becoming
          increasingly vast. When we look at the differences between the Left
          and Right through the lens of Spiral Dynamics, we start to understand
          what lies behind some of the fundamental disagreements between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, Conservatives tend to be most heavily centered on
          the Blue and Orange value systems. Blue allows them to recognize how
          difficult it is to achieving order and stability, as well as how easy
          it is to lose, driving Conservatives to seek to uphold the
          institutions and traditions which have provided the structure and
          stability that society has been founded upon. A strong group identity
          is another important facet of Blue, and we see this expressed in many
          Conservatives through a strong sense of national pride and patriotism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orange places tremendous value on individual freedom to pursue success
          and achievement, and believes that everyone should be rewarded based
          on their individual efforts. Thus, Conservatives fear government
          interference into business, and are vigilant to discourage rewarding
          free-riders and slackers. Orange sees how competition within a free
          market creates and spread abundance within society, so Conservatives
          tend to favor capitalism and see it as a means toward achieving mass
          prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other side of the political divide, Liberals are heavily
          centered on the Green value system. Green is, in many ways, a reaction
          to some of the problems created by the Blue and Orange systems,
          particularly regarding how they both create divisions within society.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green sees how the institutions and traditions of Blue (as well as the
          authority structures and hierarchies set in place to maintain them)
          are often stifling and oppressive to those who do not submit to these
          authorities or who reside at the bottom of the hierarchical heap.
          Therefore, Liberals tend to be anti-authority and anti-hierarchy, and
          see traditions and institutions as outdated and oppressive. Green also
          seeks to be all-inclusive, and thus Liberals tend to reject
          nationalism on account of the “us vs. them” mentality it generates.
          Green sees how the groupish and authoritarian tendencies of Blue have
          been the basis of many forms of marginalization and oppression. Thus,
          Liberals are especially concerned with the plight of victims of
          discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green is also highly sensitive to the divisions created by Orange in
          the form of massive wealth disparity. Orange divides society into
          winners and losers, as many have far more than what they need, while
          many more still do without. Liberals therefore tend to favor
          government intervention into business, such as stricter regulations on
          large corporations and heavier taxes on the wealthiest within society.
          They see capitalism primarily as a system of predation and
          exploitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, given this understanding, what insight does Spiral Dynamics have
          to offer? If we approach political discourse from a Second Tier
          perspective, we can to see ways in which both Liberals and
          Conservatives hold important pieces of the puzzle. They are both
          sensitive to certain threats, and they each have their own insights
          into how to solve certain problems. Blue has tremendous wisdom with
          regarding the maintenance of a stable society, and Orange provides
          insights in how to enable a society to flourish and prosper. Green
          seeks to maintain justice within society itself. Thus, both sides are
          right, but only partially. By rejecting Blue and Orange, Liberals fail
          to appreciation the importance of order and stability, as well as the
          tremendous value of capitalism’s ability to generate wealth and
          abundance. But, by rejecting Green, Conservatives are less sensitive
          to the victims within a highly stable, capitalistic society, and the
          ways in which Blue and Orange creates divisions between groups of
          people.
