        <h2>The Enterprising Self</h2>
        <p>
          Blue brought the order and stability that was severely lacking in Red
          dominated society, but as this system began to permeate and stagnate,
          many began to feel stifled by the oppression and rigidity that it
          tended to breed. The seeds of Orange were planted during The
          Renaissance and truly blossomed with The Enlightenment, as an emphasis
          on individualism and human rationalism took root in society. The
          Industrial Revolution brought the beginnings of an exponential
          increase in wealth and abundance which created new opportunities for
          the individual to pursue personal success and achievement, and the
          dawn of science gave us a new means for inquiring into truth: through
          data, observation, and experimentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the core of Orange lies the inherent beliefs that 1) things can
          change - they are not set in stone forever, and 2) we can influence
          that change – we can learn the secrets of the universe and use our
          knowledge to affect its outcome. With the arrival of Orange, the world
          becomes a market place of opportunities and possibilities for us to
          explore. There are many variables and alternatives for every problem,
          and we should test them all in search of the best solution. Our
          situation is not fixed, and we can use our ever-increasing
          understanding of the world to create and spread prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas Red’s self-expression was impulsive, Orange learns to express
          self in a more calculated, strategic way. Orange “plays the game to
          win”, harnessing the action-oriented power of Red, tempered with an
          understanding of the system and authority structures of Blue. Orange
          discovers that these systems can often be maneuvered and pacified with
          sufficient cunning and skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orange has had a profound influence on American culture, bringing with
          it the ethos of ‘The American Dream’ - the idea that freedom includes
          the opportunity for prosperity and success. Social roles and classes
          are not fixed, and upward social mobility is available to everyone
          through hard work and determination. Individuals can grow, improve,
          and progress towards being the best they can be if they but choose to
          act. If you learn to play your cards right, you can make your own pile
          of wealth and success. Competition and a free market are essential for
          creating such possibilities and opportunities.
        </p>
        <h2>The Shadow Side of Orange</h2>
        <p>
          But for all its opportunities and possibilities, Orange is often
          dismissive of the people groups at the bottom of the heap. As everyone
          scrambles to snag their piece of the pie, many fall through the cracks
          as the gap between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ becomes increasingly
          vast. It is often those existing at lower levels along the spiral who
          are victims of this free-for-all, especially those who have been
          forced to regress into unhealthy Beige.
        </p>
        <p>
          Orange thinking holds strongly to the idea that everyone can become
          what they choose to make of themselves, but this outlook fails to take
          into account that not everyone is on an equal playing field. Many are
          born with the cards stacked against them in ways that are outside of
          their control, and events throughout one’s lifetime may restrict one
          from pursuing the prosperity that Orange makes possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another pitfall of Orange is that it tends to favor short-term,
          results-oriented decision making rather than long-term planning. This
          shortsightedness has been on full display in the way that Orange
          societies have impacted the environment. Rampant materialism and
          consumerism has driven the extraction of resources from the Earth to
          supply ever-increasing demands. The devastating effect to life on this
          planet is becoming more and more critical by the day.
        </p>
        <p>
          A portrayal of the Orange mindset taken to its unhealthy extreme is
          seen in the 2013 film The Wolf of Wall Street. The character played by
          Leonardo DiCaprio epitomizes the pursuit of wealth and achievement
          with near total disregard for others. He rides a self-propelled wave
          of success and accomplishment, leaving behind a trail of victims in
          its wake. His Orange system overwhelms the community oriented levels
          of his internal Spiral. His Blue sense of guilt and ethics is nearly
          abandoned. Much of his Purple energy is redirected from his family to
          his colleagues and employees, but only in return for their adoration
          and loyalty. His Red system shines bright through the gaps created by
          these unbalances, bringing forth extreme hedonism and impulsive
          behavior.
        </p>
        <h2>The Immortal Man in Orange</h2>
        <p>
          The sixth track on the record, Enterprise, catalogues the immortal
          man’s immersion into this same sort of unbalanced Orange. He rejects
          the constricting restraints of authority and dogma and pursues
          personal success and achievement at full throttle. Having reached the
          top of socioeconomic ladder, he feels self-satisfied and prideful,
          unwilling to look down toward those who have not been given the same
          opportunities as he has, and who are in desperate need of the help he
          is now in a position to provide.{" "}
        </p>
        <h2>Orange in the Modern Church</h2>
        <p>
          Many Christian’s have integrated Orange values into their Blue
          religious framework, and not always in the healthiest of ways.
          Preachers of what has been called the ‘Prosperity Gospel’ thrive by
          appealing to the Orange desire for wealth and success.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more positive development to come out of Orange-Blue integration
          into Christianity is a movement which has sought to approach the faith
          with an emphasis on reason and rational thought. Within the academic
          world, the last half-century has seen a renaissance in Christian
          analytic philosophy, and many authors and Christian apologists have
          popularized this work from the ivory tower.
