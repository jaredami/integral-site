        <h2>The Survival Self</h2>
        <p>
          Beige represents the mode of consciousness inhabited by the earliest
          humans as they roamed across the landscape in small, loose bands of
          hunter-gatherers. Life during this period was ruthless and
          unforgiving, limiting our mental capacities to concern over what was
          necessary to survive. Beige is virtually automatic, as behaviors are
          dictated by instinct rather than logical or volitional choices. Deep
          primitive brain functions drive the desire to satisfy basic biological
          urges, such as the need for food, water, temperature control, safety,
          and reproduction. High level mental functions, such as complex
          emotions, an awareness of the past and future, and an understanding of
          cause and effect, are all limited at this stage. One does not even
          possess a defined sense of self as a distinct individual. There is no
          surplus of mental energy to devote to these matters, as practically
          all resources go toward staying alive.
        </p>
        <h2>The Immortal Man in Beige</h2>
        <p>
          The lyrics of the second track on the record, Nascent, capture the
          immortal man’s perspective within this unforgiving survivalist mode of
          being. He finds himself in a brutal and chaotic world in which the
          struggle against nature is all-consuming. Although there are glimpses
          of the possibility to expand into a broader mental space, he laments
          the harsh reality that his circumstances do no afford the luxury. At
          this point, humanity has not yet found the means to create a more
          stable way of life that releases energy for more complex thinking. For
          now, he must retreat into an automatic mode of existence for the sake
          of survival.
        </p>
        <h2>Beige in Individual Development</h2>
        <p>
          Individually, we all enter the world within Beige as infants. Our
          minds do not possess the capacity for complex thought, and our
          behaviors are limited to automatic reactions driven by biological
          needs. As our brains and minds rapidly develop, most humans soon
          progress into Purple during early childhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to Spiral Dynamics, all of the colors remain within us as we
          advance to later stages, and it is possible to revert into the earlier
          stages if the situation calls for it. In the affluent West, it is
          usually only during rare and fleeting encounters with life and death
          circumstances that we ever experience a regression into Beige, such as
          during a car crash, a home break-in, a robbery at gunpoint, etc.
        </p>
        <h2>Beige in the Modern World</h2>
        <p>
          And yet, there are still many today who are forced into a more
          permanent and unhealthy expression of Beige due to extreme stress or
          trauma. Sufferers of mental illness, victims of famine or warfare, and
          those experiencing the extremes of poverty and deprivation may be
          forced to revert to this simpler state of awareness. For example, most
          of America’s major cities are inhabited by a population of individuals
          who have been driven to homelessness by intense life conditions such
          as severe mental illness, and are left with no other option than to
          adopt a survivalist mentality in order to get by.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must not ignore the role that those of us residing at later stages
          of the Spiral have to play in causing this sort of regression into
          unhealthy Biege. Indeed, many of the unhealthy manifestations of Beige
          are merely the fallout of the later stages, which tend to marginalize
          and cast them aside. Capitalistic Orange, for example, often prefers
          to sweep Beige under the rug, out of sight and out of mind, unless
          there is some profit (economic, political, or pseudo-spiritual) to be
          gained. But unhealthy Beige is all around us, if we are only willing
          to look for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best response to people experiencing these harsh circumstances is
          nurturance and loving care. Often, people in this zone cannot even ask
          for the help they so desperately need. We must all ask ourselves what
          we are doing to contribute to this problem, and to consider ways that
          we can enable sufferers of unhealthy Beige to begin to meet their
          basic survival needs, and be able to develop further along the Spiral.
