        <h2>The Tribal Order</h2>
        <p>
          One way or another, humans in the Beige era began to discover that
          there was safety in numbers. Perhaps loose bands of hunter-gatherers
          began to use up their local resources, and were forced to move on to
          greener pastures, becoming more organized as they went. Or, it may be
          that migrating groups began to encounter outsiders, creating a need
          for social structure and harmony. Whatever the case, man eventually
          began forming into larger, more stable groups or ‘tribes’ in order to
          solve the problems of the Beige life conditions, and this communal way
          of living gave rise to the Purple system within the human mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Living within a Tribe provided an adaptive advantage and improved
          survival rates, but this meant that cooperation and group unity were
          now essential. In order for this cohesion to be successful,
          individuals had to put the needs of The Tribe ahead of their own.
          Thus, Purple arose as the first ‘sacrifice-self’ value system along
          the Spiral; the first stage where the needs of the group supersede the
          needs of the individual. One gives their life to The Tribe, and puts
          its safety above all else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tribal identity and group cohesion was reinforced by bestowing certain
          objects, places, and events with sacred significance, and then
          circling around them. Ceremonies and rituals were performed to
          emphasize the connection with the ancestors and draw the Tribe closer
          together.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          An animistic view of reality developed as we sought to explain the
          forces at work in nature which remained outside of our control.
          Animism arose as we began to view reality as being imbued with magical
          and mystical forces which determined events. Mountains and rivers,
          animals and plants, the sun and the sky - all aspects of nature have a
          spiritual essence, and these spirits must be appeased in order to
          maintain their favor. The plight of famine, drought, or success was
          explained in terms of the displeasure of the spirits, and we devised
          various ways of attempting to placate them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The emergence of culture within tribal living put higher demands on
          neurological capacities to analyze, understand, and retain collective
          memories. The first cosmic pictures of reality began to arise, as well
          as the beginnings of mythology, oral history, and art. The forces of
          nature became portable as fertility symbols, totems, amulets, relics,
          lucky charms, and medicine bags. The shaman, elders, and chieftain
          were revered for their ability to heal, maintain contact with the
          past, and facilitate group decision making.
        </p>
        <h2>The Immortal Man in Purple</h2>
        <p>
          The third track on the record, Noumina, represents the immortal man’s
          journey through Purple. He recognizes his need for community, and
          finds safety and acceptance within the tribal lifestyle. The lyrics
          capture the tribe’s intent to bring an end to a drought by joining
          together to appease the supernatural forces at work in nature. Here,
          the immortal man fully accepts that his dependence on others and on
          forces outside of his control.
        </p>
        <h2>Purple in Individual Development</h2>
        <p>
          On an individual level, the transition from Beige to Purple marks the
          end of infancy and the beginning of childhood. Babies begin to make
          cause and effect correlations, as certain behaviors are rewarded with
          food and hugs. Symbolic thinking emerges with the use of words, such
          as “mama” and “dada”. Children at this stage become attached to
          certain objects that hold and emotional significance, such a special
          blanket or teddy bear.
        </p>
        <p>
          During early childhood, the family unit serves the same communal role
          as The Tribe did for early humans. Love comes in many forms, but the
          unconditional love and acceptance within this micro-community of the
          family is an essential part of healthy growth and development. It is
          crucial at this stage that the young child learns experiences this
          profound love and acceptance. If a child moves through this stage too
          quickly, or if the Purple foundation is not firmly rooted, the entire
          Spiral grows on shaky ground.
        </p>
        <h2>Purple in Modern Culture</h2>
        <p>
          We still see pervasive elements of Purple within our modern culture
          today. Disney makes its fortune by tapping into the magical thinking
          of Purple within all of us by depicted worlds imbued with enchantment
          and wonder. Purple is also present in a variety of superstitions and
          customs that we easily dismiss: thinking twice when crossing the path
          of a black cat, responding to a sneeze with “bless you”, carrying a
          rabbit’s foot for good luck, knocking on wood, etc. The tribal unity
          and bond experienced between supporters of a particular sports team
          and the superstitions and rituals that many fans and players partake
          in are also clear signs of this color at work in our minds. The US is
          surprisingly purple regarding the American flag, as desecrating this
          sacred symbol of our nation is taken far more seriously than most
          other places in the world.
        </p>
        <h2>Purple in Christianity</h2>
        <p>
          Purple thinking also permeates Christianity in many ways. Rituals and
          ceremonies have been an important aspect of the Christian tradition
          throughout its history. The Eucharist, baptism, matrimony, and other
          sacraments can, in part, be seen as a means for Christians to
          integrate the Purple system into their faith practice through the use
          of ritual, ceremony, and rites of passage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed there are a variety of ways of understanding this disparity,
          but Spiral Dynamics provides an interesting layer of insight into this
          phenomenon. The ancient Israelites lived in a time and place in
          history that was still greatly influenced by Purple thinking. Although
          we certainly see the beginnings of both Red and Blue in these ancient
          accounts, it is clear that the prevalence of Purple at that time was
          much stronger than what we see today in the developed West. A Spiral
          Dynamics perspective offers the possibility that these ancient
          accounts are to some extent a description of an approach to connecting
          with God by people whose Purple system was still a dominate part of
          their thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiral Dynamics also helps to explain why we still see many of these
          Purple elements persisting even today. Every new system transcends and
          includes those before it. Even as new levels of the Spiral awaken,
          Purple remains with in us forever. The rituals and ceremonies
          described above can be seen as a natural and appropriate means of
          integrating our Purple system into the Christian faith.
