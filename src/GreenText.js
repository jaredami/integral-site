        <h2>The Egalitarian Order</h2>
        <p>
          Eventually, many of the “successful” achievers and strivers of Orange
          began to wonder, “Is this all there is?” Fancy houses, fast cars, and
          material abundance may have been achieved, but at a significant price.
          Again, humanity began to question why we are here and where we are
          going.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The disturbing lack of parity between people at the top and bottom of
          the socioeconomic heap became increasingly glaring. Many had more than
          they needed, while many more still did without. The environmental
          fallout of Orange’s mad dash for resources was also a growing source
          of concern. Mass media brought these issues into sharper view, and
          also exposed people to a much wider world of exotic cultures and
          ideas. The Western-white-male way of life is not the only story out
          there, and exposure to alternatives forced many to contemplate both
          the cultural supremacy and ethical integrity of the modernist way of
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Green value system exploded into American culture in the 1960s.
          Many who experienced the loneliness and isolation resulting from
          Orange individualism and competitiveness sought a return to community
          and belonging. Sharing emotions and material goods began to take the
          place of competition for status and wealth. The focus shifted to
          problems of inclusion, affiliation, and large-scale harmony. In Green,
          all voices are to be valued and given the chance to be heard, and
          decisions are to be made through open deliberation and discussion
          until a consensus can be reached. There is no place for hierarchies
          and power structures in this communitarian mode of thinking.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The plight of the marginalized and oppressed becomes a special point
          of emphasis in Green. Green questions the divisions created by both
          Orange (wealth disparity) and Blue (nationalism, ideology, class
          systems), and seeks to deconstruct them. Green sees how authority is
          oppressive, and group identities marginalize and exclude outsiders.
          Green sees that although capitalism is extremely good at creating
          freedom, it is extremely bad at creating equality, as the system tends
          to pray upon and exploit the poor for the sake of the continued
          advancement of the rich.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once again, the circle of empathy widens even further, as Green
          strives to include people of any race, gender, sexual orientation,
          religion, or socioeconomic status. Gender roles become less rigid,
          glass ceilings are opened, affirmative action plans are implemented,
          and social classes are blurred. Interest in causes that favor the
          downtrodden and helpless grows dramatically. Social safety nets,
          investment in people-oriented programs, and ‘socialized’ health care
          often run hand in hand with Green egalitarianism. Diverse people are
          brought together in the collective pursuit of inner peace through
          tolerance and acceptance. “If we all just love each other and make
          things equal for everyone (spread resources equally, equal rights,
          opportunities etc.), everything will be fine”, says Green.
        </p>
        <p>
          The certainties of Blue and scientific analysis of Orange are also
          rejected by Green. Truth is thought to in some way be
          context-dependent as cold rationality gives way to feelings and
          intuition. This relativistic mindset is catalyzed by increasing
          exposure to diverse ways of living and thinking. The spread of
          television, film, radio, and eventually the internet allow humans to
          discover a wide variety of cultural possibilities, many of which seem
          equally viable. With so many good options, maybe none is invariably
          “best”. Perhaps everyone is right in their own way, at one time or
          another. In light of this, differences are to be tolerated, and
          alternative lifestyles legitimized, so long as they do not harm
          others.
        </p>
        <h2>The Immortal Man in Green</h2>
        <p>
          The lyrics the seventh track, Empath, depict the immortal man’s foray
          into the Green mindset. His thinking becomes relativistic as his
          confidence in man’s ability to discover the truth through reason
          starts to wane. He becomes sensitive to the plight of the marginalized
          and oppressed, realizing that the greed and materialism of The
          Enterprising Self has left many to suffer. He sees that the Orange
          system has also depleted the Earth of its resources and severely
          damaged the ecosystem. He chastises Orange for ignoring these
          problems, and warns that time is running out to solve them.
        </p>
        <h2>The Shadow Side of Green</h2>
        <p>
          The awakening of the Green value system brought a return to community
          and belonging, a wider circle of empathy, heightened sensitivity to
          the downtrodden and marginalized, and greater ecological awareness.
          And yet, the Green value system has also been known to produce some of
          the nastiest examples of self-righteousness and narcissism of any of
          the value systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like all of the First Tier colors, Green thinks of itself as superior,
          enlightened, and wholly correct. It holds to its sacred values just as
          vehemently as the other colors. In particular, Green is highly
          concerned with the treatment of victim groups. This, in and of itself,
          is a noble pursuit and one which is sorely needed in the wake of
          Orange wealth disproportionality. And yet, holding this value as
          sacred and placing it above all others can blind Green from
          considering the other sides of the issue. In its concern for
          redistributing resources, extreme Green fails to consider the
          importance of creating more resources to be spread. Consumerism,
          capitalism, and the free market are what have fueled the abundance
          that enables those in Green to have the luxury of concerning
          themselves with the plight of the poor in the first place, and are in
          many ways one some of the most important tools for fixing it.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Green can also become very high in rigidity, seeking to promote all
          types of diversity besides ideological diversity. Disagreement is
          tolerated, but only as long as it is approached in the Green way
          (gently and collectively). This facet of unhealthy Green has
          manifested in extreme political correctness, even at the expense of
          free speech. Recently there has been a movement among college students
          to scrub campuses clean of words, ideas, and subjects that might cause
          discomfort or give offense. Terms such as “triggers-warnings” and
          “micro-aggressions” have permeated student vernacular, leaving
          professors afraid to speak freely or to say anything that might offend
          or “traumatize”. When Green is taken to its extreme, catering to
          individual feelings and emotions takes precedence over accuracy and
          objectivity. Some worry that this excessive coddling will leave
          students unprepared for entering the real world, where their fragile
          emotions won’t be so gently catered to.
        </p>
        <p>
          This rigidity also causes extreme Green to be highly susceptible to
          group-think. Green tends to be strongly influenced by input from one’s
          social circle. The desire to remain part of the group and to maintain
          harmony causes many to “go along to get along.” Rather than think for
          one’s self, or express an opinion that might challenge the sacred
          values of the group, it is easier just to go along with the crowd. In
          some cases, this desire for acceptance can be used as manipulation by
          others, as failure to conform to Green values is met with shaming,
          withholding of affect, and exclusion from the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green’s desire to abolish hierarchy and to reach conclusions only
          through consensus can also leave it incapable of taking action
          efficiently. So much time is spent on making sure that everyone’s
          voice is heard and that everyone’s perspective is legitimized that it
          becomes nearly impossible to move forward and make decisions. This
          reportedly became an issue during the peak of the Occupy Wall Street
          movement, which sought to reach conclusions through a process known as
          ‘General Assembly’. This procedure was an attempt to ensure that all
          perspectives on a given issue would be allowed to be expressed, and
          that decisions would be reached only by consensus within the group.
          This rendered the movement virtually incapable of making decisions in
          a reasonably timely manner due to their desire not to excluding any
          person or perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet another common pitfall of excessive Green is collective guilt.
          Whereas Blue feels guilt for personal transgressions, Green feels it
          for the shortcomings of the group – a nation, a race, a company, an
          economic class, etc. This “we have let them down” mentality can lead
          to burnout or a frustrated feeling that “there is nothing that I can
          do to help.” The pressures of caring can become overwhelming, putting
          people in heavy Green at increased risk for depression and suicide. It
          is important for Green to utilize Orange strategic thinking, and to be
          able to realize when the group is investing in a losing cause or when
          resource should be directed elsewhere to have maximal impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Green is in many ways a response to the extremes of Blue and Orange.
          It points out the very real problems created by a society dominated by
          these two systems, and seeks to repair the divisions created by both
          of them. But, by rejecting Blue and Orange altogether, Green fails to
          recognize the valuable insights they both have to offer.{" "}
