        <h2>The Power Self</h2>
        <p>
          While Beige was self-oriented by necessity and due to conceptual
          limitations, Red is where one’s sense of self as an individual truly
          arises. Historically, the transition from Purple to Red began as
          certain individuals sought greater personal autonomy. As Purple became
          more successful at meeting safety and security needs, some of its
          magical and fear based control was lost. There became a growing sense
          among some that a powerful individual can actually influence the
          world. A reliance on strong people in addition to strong spirits arose
          within the tribe, and as groups of Purple were forced into competition
          with other Purple groups for land and resources, individuals who
          asserted themselves and took charge were rewarded with power and
          respect.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Red sees the world as a harsh and dangerous environment. There are
          ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’, and it’s better to be a have. During the
          period of history in which Red arose, we saw the rise of warlords,
          emperors, and kings (Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, etc.), who sought
          to use their own strength and abilities to rise to the top and exert
          dominance over others. Red tends to be impulsive and hedonistic,
          seeking to gratify his desires immediately. You may not live to see
          tomorrow, so why worry about consequences which may not come? All that
          matters is what feels good in the moment, and there is little regard
          for others or for future consequences.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          Red can be very heroic and courageous due to its desire for “dragons
          to slay.” Red needs obstacles to attack and overcome in order to prove
          its abilities and self-reliance. Red is also highly concerned with
          maintaining honor and respect, but it is primarily driven out of a
          concern or one’s reputation and the influence it has on their ability
          to enjoy themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Red we see a shift in how humanity understands the spiritual forces
          at play in the world. We began to realize that placating the spirits
          does not always work – they are unpredictable, unreliable, and
          sometimes capricious. In Red, the gods develop more human-like
          characters and foibles; they are spiteful, demanding, jealous, and
          whimsically beneficent. We see these sorts of unpredictable deities in
          the mythology of the Greek Pantheon, for example.
        </p>
        <h2>The Immortal Man in Red</h2>
        <p>
          The fourth track on the album, Overlord, depicts the immortal man’s
          mindset at the peak of Red. He has discovered a need to break loose
          from the tribe, exert independent control, and test himself self
          against the world and others. The immortal man has fully embraced this
          warlord mentality, and seeks to carve out his own space in an
          unforgiving world. He pursues power and dominance relentlessly, with
          no regard for the consequences of his actions. It is only by the very
          last line in the song that he begins to realize the hurt and damage he
          has caused to those around him.
        </p>
        <h2>Red in Individual Development</h2>
        <p>
          While many of us may look back on the Red era from our modern
          perspective with disdain, it is important to remember that Red exists
          within in us all. The development of one’s ego and sense of
          individuality is a crucial part of human development. The need to
          stride out from under the protective wings of the tribe and test one’s
          own abilities against the world is a natural expression of this stage
          which we often see taking hold in the preteen and early teenage years.
          ‘Running away from home’ is a common undertaking of many frustrated
          youth seeking to express their Red independence. If authoritarian
          parents squash their child’s first expressions of rebellion too
          harshly, they may freeze in anger for life. A child being forced into
          Blue too early only proves that life is unfair, and that fighting back
          is the best course of action.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          We owe a lot to the Red system within us. Red thinking it what gives
          us the confidence to stand up for ourselves, and to believe in our own
          abilities to overcome adversity. Some of the most profound acts of
          bravery and courageousness are seen in people operating from this
          mindset. When balanced with other colors, Red’s ability to take
          decisive action is a desirable trait in many circumstances. Red’s
          hedonistic tendencies can also be expressed positively when balanced
          within the Spiral, as healthy Red is able to realize that there are
          times and places to immerse one’s self in pleasure and simply enjoy
          the present moment.
        </p>
        <h2>Red in the Modern World</h2>
        <p>
          One of the greatest issues facing developed nations today is finding
          healthy alternatives in which Red energy can be expressed
          constructively. When the Purple need for a strong sense of belonging
          isn’t met by the nuclear family, Red escalates and seeks alternative
          means of fulfilling the void. This problem is especially evident in
          much of the urban poor in our society, as many of today’s youth find
          their Purple anchor by joining a gang, and express unhealthy Red
          through violence and criminal activity. Movement up the Spiral seems
          to not be an option. Life is hard and dangerous. A short life
          expectancy and constant danger come with the territory. Mugging
          tourists or dealing crack may seem like an effective response in such
          an environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The solution to these problems, contrary to what some politicians and
          commentators may claim, often does not include imprisonment or
          simplistic, self-righteous preaching. Peak Red does not learn through
          punishment since there is little concern for future consequences,
          guilt is limited, and problems are almost always blamed on someone
          else. Here is a prime example where an understanding of the Spiral
          might aid us in our ability to help others. First, alternative Purple
          nests must be provided: sports teams, surrogate families, effective
          child care, etc. Then, the processing of redirecting unhealthy Red
          into more constructive avenues can begin. The discipline of martial
          arts serves this function remarkably well.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its best, Red thinking is about limitless self-expression and
          boldly taking action. In the right circumstances and given the right
          direction, it can appear decisive and courageous. As we move through
          the Red stage of our personal development, we learn the value of
          trusting ourselves to face the challenges of the world directly. At
          its worst, Red is expressed through short-sighted anger and impulsive
          arrogance. Unhealthy Red can show up as unrestrained rebelliousness
          and aggression and a disregard for others. We must eventually learn to
          incorporate the empowerment and action-orientation of Red with the
          important elements of the other value systems, such as tribal family
          bonds of Purple or the respect for authority and future planning that
          we learn from Blue.
